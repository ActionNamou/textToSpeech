It is the employee’s responsi bility to inform Human Resources of any changes to their personal information 
as soon as possible.   
2.5 Probationary Period  
 
Action Aero recognizes that you put as much thought into choosing your employer as Action Aero did in 
selecting you to be part of the Action Aero Team.  That is why it is important that both you and Action 
Aero have time to assess the decision.  
For all new hires, an introductory or probationary period of six (6) months is stipulated directly in the 
employment agreement. During the pr obationary period, the Team Leader will monitor the new 
employee’s progress and performance. Employees are also expected to ascertain their fit with the 
Company during this time, including learning specific job duties and getting to know other employees.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                   
After the probationary period ends, a feedback session will t ake place between the employee and their Team 
Leader, in which the employee is encouraged to provide input. Following the feedback session and 
successful completion of the Controlled Goods Program a decision will be made on whether or not to move 
the emplo yee to a permanent position.   
There may be a situation, where it is determined a probationary period requires an extension to further 
evaluate an employee’s skills. If this is the case, the employee will be made aware of this during the above 
feedback sess ion.  
2.6 Progressive Discipline  
The Company may impose discipline for workplace infractions in its sole and exclusive discretion. 
Disciplinary action may include, but is not limited to, verbal or written warnings, or suspension. Lastly, 
employees may be t erminated if the seriousness of their actions warrant it.  
 9 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  In the event an employee violates company policy or exhibits problematic behavior, a system of 
progressive discipline has been put in place. Employees will be given three (3) opportunities to correct the 
unwanted behavior or actions.  
See steps below:  
Step 1 – Verbal Warning  
A meeting will be arranged,  and the employee will be advised of the issue and asked for their 
interpretation of what occurred. The employee will be informed of the expectati ons of the company and 
suggestions on to improve the behavior so no further action is required. The conversation will be 
documented and added to the employee ’s file. 
Step 2 – Written Warning  
A meeting will take place to address further infractions followin g the Verbal Warning. The concern will be 
reviewed with the employee, explanation requested,  and suggestions of improvement will be provided. The 
employee will be informed further examples of this behavior result in a final written warning. The 
conversatio n will be documented to the employee ’s file. 
Step 3 – Final Warning or Suspension  
A meeting will be held to address the continued behavior, indicating improvements have not been made 
since the Written Warning. An explanation will be requested from the employee,  and they will be advised 
if there continues to be no improvement the next step in the process is termination.  
A suspension may be warranted rather than a termination, if that is the case , the length  and details of the 
suspension would depend on t he circumstances of the incident.  
Step 4 – Termination  
All terminations will be arranged and coordinated through Human Resources.  
2.7 Notice of Termination  
In the event Action Aero terminates an employee the Employment Standards Act requiring notice will be 
followed, see below:  
● If an employee has worked continuously for more than 6 months but less than 5 years : 2 weeks 
written notice is required.    
● If an employee has worked continuously for more than 5 years, but less than 10 years : 4 weeks 
written notice is required.

the President, HR or their Team Leader, as follows:  10 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  ● If an employee has worked continuously for more than 6 months but less than 5 years : 1 weeks 
written notice is required.    
● If an employee has worked continuously for more than 5 years : 2 weeks written notice is required.    
 
During an employee’s probationar y period the employer has the right to terminate an employee without 
notice and without cause, for any reason that is not discriminatory. The employee may terminate the 
agreement without notice during the probationary period.  
Termination for cause may occu r when Progressive Discipline has been followed and there has been no 
change in behavior. Notice of termination is not required.  
2.8 Immigration

b. Making sure  temporary workers follow the conditions and time limits outlined in their work 
permit,

2.9 Political Neutrality  
 
Under no circumstances will Action Aero discriminate against any employee based on their support  of or 
participation in any political activity, so long as such activity is within the bounds of the law. The 
Company will not take any p unitive action or discriminate against an employee based on their lawful 
political engagement outside the workplace. If an employee engages in any political activity, the 
employee must clearly state that such activity and related statements in no way repre sent the views of the 
Company. Additionally, all Company employees are entitled to their own personal political positions.  
 
2.10 Cellphones  
Personal  cell phone use can be disruptive to others and limit employee productivity. As such, use outside 
designated breaks and mealtimes  while at work is not permitted  on the shop floor without prior 
authorization . 
If a call must be made or received during workin g hours, it should be kept as brief as possible. Personal 
long distance calls on company lines are not permitted .   
Abuse of telephone privileges may result in disciplinary action.  11 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  Employees in certain positions may be provided with cell phone allowances to improve productivity and 
efficiency. Full compliance with all Company policies is required when conducting Company business via 
any mobile device.  
2.11 Performance Reviews   
 
All employees will participate in the Action Aero annual performance review pro cess.  The purpose of this 
process is to assist the employee and their Team Leader in the evaluation of their performance and to set 
realistic and objective goals for the year ahead. This is an interactive process, and employees are encouraged 
to participa te and add feedback. Performance Reviews will be performed at least once a year.  Performance 
reviews are personal and confidential. All employee reviews will be kept in the employee’s personnel file.  
Employees  are strongly encouraged to contact their Team Leader anytime you have a question or concern 
regarding their performance.  
2.12 Attendance   
 
All employees  are expected to be punctual with regular attendance. The company relies on an employee’s 
regular attendance to run an efficient and successful business.  When an employee is absent or late, 
production in their work group is affected.  Absence disrupts wor k planning and places a burden on co -
workers who may have to assume additional duties or are required to work overtime.   
Action Aero recognizes that illness and other personal issues may make it impossible to report to work, in 
these circumstances the Com pany asks that the employee  notify  their Team Leader (prior to their start time) 
and then update Pay Works with their absence. Do not have another person call for you unless it is 
unavoidable.  
We suggest all employees arrive a minimum of 15 minutes prior t o shift start to ensure they are ready to 
begin work at their scheduled time.   
Frequent or excess ive absenteeism or tardiness may result in disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination.  
 
If an employee is going to be absent three or more days due to illness or injury (non -work related) they are 
required to provide medical documentation (Action Aero Medical Form) from their physician to their 
supervisor by the start of day four of the absence. The Physician's note should include:  
a) The date the condit ion began.  
b) The estimated duration of the leave; and,  
c) A statement advising the employee is unable to perform his/her duties due their current 
condition.  
If the illness is anticipated to extend beyond 7 days, the employee will be issued a Record of Employment, 
as they may be eligible for sick pay benefits under Employment Insurance, details of the coverage can be 
found at:  
http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/ei/bene fits/sickness.shtml  12 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  In the case of adverse weather, the Company may decide to delay opening of the facility or close for the 
day. Any delays/closures will be posted in Pay Works, on the Action Aero Facebook page and Twitter . 
Any time lost due to weather wi ll be unpaid. The employee may be able to make up the hours missed or 
take vacation.  
 
Please use your judgement when travelling in adverse weather conditions.  
 
2.13 Job Vacancy  
 
All job vacancies will be posted at the discretion of management. All employees are eligible to apply for

Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  6.2 Personal Leave/Sick Leave  
As legislated, an employ ee is entitled to 3 unpaid sick days per year. In addition to those days, the Company 
will provide employees with an additional five (5) days or 40 hours paid personal/sick leave.  
It is suggested that the employee consider personal/sick leave days as an i nsurance policy against illness 
and emergencies for the year.  It is not additional vacation time and thus cannot be added to a vacation or 
statutory holiday, except in the case of illness.  
Personal/Sick leave is intended to be used for unexpected events;  therefore,  advance notice is not required. 
If an employee chooses to use personal/sick leave for non -emergency use (i.e. medical or dental 
appointment), advance notice should be provided so production and their co -workers are not adversely 
affected by the absence.  P ersonal/sick leave taken beyond the time submitted, or under false pretense, will 
be considered an unauthorized absence.   
Any time which is unused by the end of the calendar year can be either paid out on the first pay of the 
following year or carried ove r into the new year.  If an employee resigns, is terminated, or laid off, any 
remaining personal/sick leave credit will not be paid out .  
Should an employee be required to take  time due to personal or family member’s illness, medical 
appointment or test, a nd their personal/sick leave accumulated to date has been used, the employee is 
required to make the time up or use vacation time .  
If an employee who resigns from the company before the end of the year the employee may be required to 
pay back personal/sic k hours used which have not been accrued. These hours will be deducted from the 
employee’s final pay.  
For example:  
An employee leaves the Company in April, however,  uses all their personal/sick time (40 hours) in January 
to March there may be an adjustment to the employee’s final pay.  
New employees will be eligible for personal/sick leave upon the satisfactory completion of their 
probationary period.  This leave will  be pro -rated based on the employee’s first weeks of employment in 
their first year of service.  
Personal/sick leave can be used in one (1) hour segments, up to a total of forty (40) hours.  Either in advance 
of taking personal health leave or upon return i f the leave was unplanned .

and contin uous improvement.  
We continuously improve our compliance and business practices. We establish quantifiable, annual goals 
to measure and drive sustained safety and environmental performance. Our executives and managers are 
measured and held accountable for the safety and environmental performance of their businesses.  
Our Health and Safety Committee is composed of management and non -management employees. Some of 
the primary responsibilities of the committee are to formulate and update safety guidelines, to co nduct and 
arrange safety training and keep up to date on provincial and federal government regulations concerning

Computer Software and Social Media Acceptable Use Policy  
Date of Policy : April 1, 2013  
Action Aero diligently maintains its profile as a good corporate citizen, locally, nationally and 
internationally.  
Computer Software  
In addition to the risks of viruses affecting our computers, unauthorized software is also illegal. Software 
companies have become increasingly aggressive and active in searching out, publicizing and prosecuting 
companies running illegal copies of  software. Action Aero cannot afford being identified as using, or in 
any way supporting the use of unauthorized software on our systems.  
To this end, we have established the following company policies:

• No unauthorized moving of software or hardware is permitted.  
• Users take the responsibility of creating and deleting their files as need and space require.

• No copying of company files for anything other than company use is permitted.  
• Usage of USB memory drives is strictly prohibited unless authorized by Management.

Management.  
Action Aero has adopted a zero -tolerance policy for unauthorized software. Action Aero cannot afford to 
run the risk of losing some or all of our corporate data. Non -authorized software found on computers will 
result in removal of the computer and/or term ination of network privileges . 
Social Media  
Social media refers to Web -based technologies that allow users to publish content and interact online. Social

your official role and post on social networking sites anything that could compromise your status as an 
employee of Action Aero and/ or undermine the impartiality and effectiveness of the company.  Your duty 
as an employee includes a responsibility to refrain from public criticism of Action Aero and its employees.  
You must balance your right to freedom of ex pression with your responsibilities as an employee, and avoid 
conflicts of interest.  31 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  You have a responsibility to refrain from disclosing confidential information about Action Aero, its clients 
and its employees.  A significant amount of harm can result fr om disclosing confidential information online 
as this information can be easily distributed and broadly reproduced and ultimately used in ways that harm 
Action Aero, its clients and employees.  
• For example, you must not make your LinkedIn information availa ble to the internet public at large.  
You should mark it private and only let those whom you allow, see your contacts and other 
information.  Otherwise, you could unwittingly allow anyone on the Internet to see your entire 
network, including clients.  
Thank  you for your cooperation.  
Management  
I have read the above and agree to comply with the Action Aero Computer Software and Social Media

Workplace Harassment Policy  
Date of Policy : April 1, 2013  
Policy Statement :  
E very employee is entitled to employment free of sexual harassment.  Action Aero commits that all of its 
employees will be treated fairly in the workplace and Action Aero will make every reasonable effort to 
ensure that no employee is subject to discrimination, personal and sexual harassment and other types of 
unwelcome comments and conduct. Employees should take note of the discriminatory practice’s 
provisions of the Human Rights Act R.S.P.E.I. 1988, Cap. H -12, that pertain to rights of persons to seek 
redress under that Act.                                                                                                                                               
 “Harassment” includes any unwelcome behaviour, c onduct or communication directed at any individual 
that is based on gender, marital status, sexual orientation, race, colour, religion, ethnic origin, ancestry, 
family status, place of origin, citizenship, age or disability.  
“Sexual harassment” means any c onduct, comment, gesture or contact of a sexual nature  
a) That is likely to cause offense or humiliation to any employee; or  
b) That might, on reasonable grounds, be perceived by that employee as placing a condition of a sexual 
nature on employment or on any opp ortunity for training or promotion  
The behaviour need not be intentional.  There are three defining characteristics of behavior that constitutes 
sexual harassment:  
• It is of a sexual nature.  
• It is unwelcome.  
• It has detrimental consequences.  
It may include, but is not limited to, the following:  
• An implied or expressed threat of reprisal for failure to comply with a sexually oriented request;  
• A demand for sexual favours in return for (continued) employment or more favourable 
employment treatment;  
• Unwelcome rem arks, jokes, innuendoes, propositions, or taunting about a person’s body, attire, 
sex or sexual orientation;  
• Displaying pornographic or sexist materials or pictures;  
• Leering (suggestive persistent staring);  
• Physical conduct such as touching, patting or pin ching, with an underlying sexual connotation;  
• Sexual assault.  
 
Sexual harassment can be initiated by either sex against the opposite sex or against a member of the same 
sex. 33 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  What to do if Harassment occurs:  
If you feel that you are being harassed, you need  to immediately make the alleged harasser aware of your 
disapproval and/or uneasiness.  Do not ignore the harassing behaviour.  To avoid any misunderstanding, 
you should clearly state to the person that you perceive the action/behaviour as harassment, and request 
that it stop immediately.  
If a further incident occurs, or if the initial incident is of such a nature that you wish to formally report it, 
you must immediately contact either your Team Leader or President.  You should make a written record 
(statem ent) of all incidents, including the nature of the behaviours, dates, times, witnesses (if any) and any 
action taken to inform the alleged harasser of disapproval.  
The Company’s response to a complaint:  
All complaints will be handled in a confidential an d timely manner.  Investigation of a complaint will 
normally include conferring with the parties involved and any named or apparent witnesses.  Everyone 
involved will be protected from coercion, intimidation, retaliation, interference or discrimination, as  a 
result of lodging the complaint or assisting in the investigation.  
Sexual and/or personal harassment of an employee is considered a serious offense and if found to be true, 
prompt attention and action designed to immediately stop the harassment and to p revent its recurrence 
will be taken.  In addition, any employee who is found to have violated the Company policy will be 
disciplined to the extent that appears appropriate in the circumstances.  Disciplinary action may range 
from a verbal warning to immedi ate termination of employment.   
The Company recognizes that a false accusation of sexual or personal harassment can have serious effects 
on innocent individuals.  Accordingly, we trust that all employees will act in a responsible manner when 
considering m aking a complaint under this policy.

2.5 Probationary Period  
 
Action Aero recognizes that you put as much thought into choosing your employer as Action Aero did in 
selecting you to be part of the Action Aero Team.  That is why it is important that both you and Action 
Aero have time to assess the decision.  
For all new hires, an introductory or probationary period of six (6) months is stipulated directly in the 
employment agreement. During the pr obationary period, the Team Leader will monitor the new 
employee’s progress and performance. Employees are also expected to ascertain their fit with the 
Company during this time, including learning specific job duties and getting to know other employees.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                   
After the probationary period ends, a feedback session will t ake place between the employee and their Team 
Leader, in which the employee is encouraged to provide input. Following the feedback session and 
successful completion of the Controlled Goods Program a decision will be made on whether or not to move 
the emplo yee to a permanent position.   
There may be a situation, where it is determined a probationary period requires an extension to further 
evaluate an employee’s skills. If this is the case, the employee will be made aware of this during the above 
feedback sess ion.  
2.6 Progressive Discipline  
The Company may impose discipline for workplace infractions in its sole and exclusive discretion. 
Disciplinary action may include, but is not limited to, verbal or written warnings, or suspension. Lastly, 
employees may be t erminated if the seriousness of their actions warrant it.

suggestions on to improve the behavior so no further action is required. The conversation will be 
documented and added to the employee ’s file.

to participa te and add feedback. Performance Reviews will be performed at least once a year.  Performance 
reviews are personal and confidential. All employee reviews will be kept in the employee’s personnel file.  
Employees  are strongly encouraged to contact their Team Leader anytime you have a question or concern 
regarding their performance.  
2.12 Attendance   
 
All employees  are expected to be punctual with regular attendance. The company relies on an employee’s 
regular attendance to run an efficient and successful business.  When an employee is absent or late, 
production in their work group is affected.  Absence disrupts wor k planning and places a burden on co -
workers who may have to assume additional duties or are required to work overtime.   
Action Aero recognizes that illness and other personal issues may make it impossible to report to work, in 
these circumstances the Com pany asks that the employee  notify  their Team Leader (prior to their start time) 
and then update Pay Works with their absence. Do not have another person call for you unless it is 
unavoidable.  
We suggest all employees arrive a minimum of 15 minutes prior t o shift start to ensure they are ready to 
begin work at their scheduled time.   
Frequent or excess ive absenteeism or tardiness may result in disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination.  
 
If an employee is going to be absent three or more days due to illness or injury (non -work related) they are 
required to provide medical documentation (Action Aero Medical Form) from their physician to their 
supervisor by the start of day four of the absence. The Physician's note should include:  
a) The date the condit ion began.  
b) The estimated duration of the leave; and,  
c) A statement advising the employee is unable to perform his/her duties due their current 
condition.  
If the illness is anticipated to extend beyond 7 days, the employee will be issued a Record of Employment, 
as they may be eligible for sick pay benefits under Employment Insurance, details of the coverage can be 
found at:

will be selected for the position . 
 
2.14 Accommodation  
 
The Company also provides all reasonable accommodations to those with disabilities in compliance with 
the law. The Company has a duty to accommodate up to the  point of undue hardship. Undue Hardship

● An expense that is difficult for the Company to absorb,  
 
● An undue hindrance  to the proper functioning of the Company,  
 
● A significant impairment of the safety or rights of others.  
 
Consequently, if the Company or service provider can objectively demonstrate that the only 
accommodation, within its reach, would result in one of these consequences, it may refuse the request for 
reasonable accommodation.  
 
It is the employee’s responsibility to bring to the Company’s attention any needs related to any disability 
so the Company can support the employee properly.  Medical documentation of the disability may be  
needed.

accommodate others as required by law.

 20 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  6.2 Personal Leave/Sick Leave  
As legislated, an employ ee is entitled to 3 unpaid sick days per year. In addition to those days, the Company 
will provide employees with an additional five (5) days or 40 hours paid personal/sick leave.  
It is suggested that the employee consider personal/sick leave days as an i nsurance policy against illness 
and emergencies for the year.  It is not additional vacation time and thus cannot be added to a vacation or 
statutory holiday, except in the case of illness.  
Personal/Sick leave is intended to be used for unexpected events;  therefore,  advance notice is not required. 
If an employee chooses to use personal/sick leave for non -emergency use (i.e. medical or dental 
appointment), advance notice should be provided so production and their co -workers are not adversely 
affected by the absence.  P ersonal/sick leave taken beyond the time submitted, or under false pretense, will 
be considered an unauthorized absence.   
Any time which is unused by the end of the calendar year can be either paid out on the first pay of the 
following year or carried ove r into the new year.  If an employee resigns, is terminated, or laid off, any 
remaining personal/sick leave credit will not be paid out .  
Should an employee be required to take  time due to personal or family member’s illness, medical 
appointment or test, a nd their personal/sick leave accumulated to date has been used, the employee is 
required to make the time up or use vacation time .  
If an employee who resigns from the company before the end of the year the employee may be required to 
pay back personal/sic k hours used which have not been accrued. These hours will be deducted from the 
employee’s final pay.  
For example:  
An employee leaves the Company in April, however,  uses all their personal/sick time (40 hours) in January 
to March there may be an adjustment to the employee’s final pay.  
New employees will be eligible for personal/sick leave upon the satisfactory completion of their 
probationary period.  This leave will  be pro -rated based on the employee’s first weeks of employment in 
their first year of service.  
Personal/sick leave can be used in one (1) hour segments, up to a total of forty (40) hours.  Either in advance 
of taking personal health leave or upon return i f the leave was unplanned . 
6.3 Short Term Disability  
Short -term disability applies to illness or injury that persists for up to 120 days.  
This leave requires employee’s healthcare provider complete the Action Aero Medical Form and include:  
a) The date the condition began.  
b) The estimated duration of the leave; and,  
c) A statement advising the employee is unable to perform his/her duties due their current 
condition.  21 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  While on Short Term Disability Leave, for the employee to maintain company health and  dental benefits, 
they will be required to provide payment for their portion of the benefit premiums, by way of e -transfer. 
Payments must be paid on the 1st day of each month in which the employee is absent from work.  Failure 
to pay for their contribution  may result in termination of benefits in accordance with our insurance policies.  
When on a Short -Term Medical Leave, the employee is required to contact their Team Leader bi-weekly  to 
provide an update of their progress or change in condition.  
6.4 Long -Term Disability  (LTD)  
In the event an employee at Action Aero Inc. is diagnosed with an illness or injury  (work related/ non-work  
related)  resulting in a Long -Term Disability claim, the employee must be away from work for a period of 
121 days due to the il lness or injury. If this is the case, the employee must advise their  Team Leader  or 
Human Resources , they will guide the employee through the LTD process and the necessary paperwork.  
Eligibility for LTD Benefits is adjudicated and approved by the insurer.  
For the first 12 months of being disabled, the employee will be eligible to participate fully in the benefit 
plan at the same cost sharing formula in place prior to the disability.  
● At the 12 -month mark, the disabled employee will be eligible to remain on the plan with full 
coverage but cost sharing by the company will cease at that point.  
● At the first of the month following 24 months of disability, the employee will be terminated from 
the benefit plan . 
What does our LTD plan cover?

Workplace Harassment Policy

Policy Statement :  
E very employee is entitled to employment free of sexual harassment.  Action Aero commits that all of its 
employees will be treated fairly in the workplace and Action Aero will make every reasonable effort to 
ensure that no employee is subject to discrimination, personal and sexual harassment and other types of 
unwelcome comments and conduct. Employees should take note of the discriminatory practice’s 
provisions of the Human Rights Act R.S.P.E.I. 1988, Cap. H -12, that pertain to rights of persons to seek 
redress under that Act.                                                                                                                                               
 “Harassment” includes any unwelcome behaviour, c onduct or communication directed at any individual 
that is based on gender, marital status, sexual orientation, race, colour, religion, ethnic origin, ancestry, 
family status, place of origin, citizenship, age or disability.  
“Sexual harassment” means any c onduct, comment, gesture or contact of a sexual nature  
a) That is likely to cause offense or humiliation to any employee; or  
b) That might, on reasonable grounds, be perceived by that employee as placing a condition of a sexual 
nature on employment or on any opp ortunity for training or promotion  
The behaviour need not be intentional.  There are three defining characteristics of behavior that constitutes 
sexual harassment:  
• It is of a sexual nature.  
• It is unwelcome.  
• It has detrimental consequences.  
It may include, but is not limited to, the following:

• Physical conduct such as touching, patting or pin ching, with an underlying sexual connotation;  
• Sexual assault.  
 
Sexual harassment can be initiated by either sex against the opposite sex or against a member of the same 
sex. 33 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  What to do if Harassment occurs:  
If you feel that you are being harassed, you need  to immediately make the alleged harasser aware of your 
disapproval and/or uneasiness.  Do not ignore the harassing behaviour.  To avoid any misunderstanding, 
you should clearly state to the person that you perceive the action/behaviour as harassment, and request 
that it stop immediately.  
If a further incident occurs, or if the initial incident is of such a nature that you wish to formally report it, 
you must immediately contact either your Team Leader or President.  You should make a written record 
(statem ent) of all incidents, including the nature of the behaviours, dates, times, witnesses (if any) and any 
action taken to inform the alleged harasser of disapproval.  
The Company’s response to a complaint:  
All complaints will be handled in a confidential an d timely manner.  Investigation of a complaint will 
normally include conferring with the parties involved and any named or apparent witnesses.  Everyone 
involved will be protected from coercion, intimidation, retaliation, interference or discrimination, as  a 
result of lodging the complaint or assisting in the investigation.  
Sexual and/or personal harassment of an employee is considered a serious offense and if found to be true, 
prompt attention and action designed to immediately stop the harassment and to p revent its recurrence 
will be taken.  In addition, any employee who is found to have violated the Company policy will be 
disciplined to the extent that appears appropriate in the circumstances.  Disciplinary action may range 
from a verbal warning to immedi ate termination of employment.   
The Company recognizes that a false accusation of sexual or personal harassment can have serious effects 
on innocent individuals.  Accordingly, we trust that all employees will act in a responsible manner when 
considering m aking a complaint under this policy.

2.5 Probationary Period  
 
Action Aero recognizes that you put as much thought into choosing your employer as Action Aero did in 
selecting you to be part of the Action Aero Team.  That is why it is important that both you and Action 
Aero have time to assess the decision.  
For all new hires, an introductory or probationary period of six (6) months is stipulated directly in the 
employment agreement. During the pr obationary period, the Team Leader will monitor the new 
employee’s progress and performance. Employees are also expected to ascertain their fit with the 
Company during this time, including learning specific job duties and getting to know other employees.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                   
After the probationary period ends, a feedback session will t ake place between the employee and their Team 
Leader, in which the employee is encouraged to provide input. Following the feedback session and 
successful completion of the Controlled Goods Program a decision will be made on whether or not to move 
the emplo yee to a permanent position.   
There may be a situation, where it is determined a probationary period requires an extension to further

progressive discipline has been put in place. Employees will be given three (3) opportunities to correct the 
unwanted behavior or actions.  
See steps below:  
Step 1 – Verbal Warning  
A meeting will be arranged,  and the employee will be advised of the issue and asked for their 
interpretation of what occurred. The employee will be informed of the expectati ons of the company and 
suggestions on to improve the behavior so no further action is required. The conversation will be 
documented and added to the employee ’s file. 
Step 2 – Written Warning  
A meeting will take place to address further infractions followin g the Verbal Warning. The concern will be 
reviewed with the employee, explanation requested,  and suggestions of improvement will be provided. The 
employee will be informed further examples of this behavior result in a final written warning. The 
conversatio n will be documented to the employee ’s file. 
Step 3 – Final Warning or Suspension  
A meeting will be held to address the continued behavior, indicating improvements have not been made 
since the Written Warning. An explanation will be requested from the employee,  and they will be advised 
if there continues to be no improvement the next step in the process is termination.  
A suspension may be warranted rather than a termination, if that is the case , the length  and details of the 
suspension would depend on t he circumstances of the incident.  
Step 4 – Termination  
All terminations will be arranged and coordinated through Human Resources.

to participa te and add feedback. Performance Reviews will be performed at least once a year.  Performance 
reviews are personal and confidential. All employee reviews will be kept in the employee’s personnel file.  
Employees  are strongly encouraged to contact their Team Leader anytime you have a question or concern 
regarding their performance.  
2.12 Attendance   
 
All employees  are expected to be punctual with regular attendance. The company relies on an employee’s 
regular attendance to run an efficient and successful business.  When an employee is absent or late, 
production in their work group is affected.  Absence disrupts wor k planning and places a burden on co -
workers who may have to assume additional duties or are required to work overtime.   
Action Aero recognizes that illness and other personal issues may make it impossible to report to work, in 
these circumstances the Com pany asks that the employee  notify  their Team Leader (prior to their start time) 
and then update Pay Works with their absence. Do not have another person call for you unless it is 
unavoidable.  
We suggest all employees arrive a minimum of 15 minutes prior t o shift start to ensure they are ready to 
begin work at their scheduled time.   
Frequent or excess ive absenteeism or tardiness may result in disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination.  
 
If an employee is going to be absent three or more days due to illness or injury (non -work related) they are 
required to provide medical documentation (Action Aero Medical Form) from their physician to their 
supervisor by the start of day four of the absence. The Physician's note should include:  
a) The date the condit ion began.  
b) The estimated duration of the leave; and,  
c) A statement advising the employee is unable to perform his/her duties due their current 
condition.  
If the illness is anticipated to extend beyond 7 days, the employee will be issued a Record of Employment, 
as they may be eligible for sick pay benefits under Employment Insurance, details of the coverage can be 
found at:  
http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/ei/bene fits/sickness.shtml  12

any job vacancy posted, however to be considered for the position the employee must have satisfactory 
performance evaluations, good attendance and possess the skills ne cessary for the vacated position.  
 
All expressions of interest will be held in confidence. While it is in the interest of Action Aero to provide 
opportunities to existing Action Aero employees, the most suitable of all internal  and external candidates 
will be selected for the position . 
 
2.14 Accommodation  
 
The Company also provides all reasonable accommodations to those with disabilities in compliance with 
the law. The Company has a duty to accommodate up to the  point of undue hardship. Undue Hardship 
may b e considered excessive in cases where the accommodation creates:  
 
● An expense that is difficult for the Company to absorb,  
 
● An undue hindrance  to the proper functioning of the Company,  
 
● A significant impairment of the safety or rights of others.  
 
Consequently, if the Company or service provider can objectively demonstrate that the only 
accommodation, within its reach, would result in one of these consequences, it may refuse the request for 
reasonable accommodation.  
 
It is the employee’s responsibility to bring to the Company’s attention any needs related to any disability 
so the Company can support the employee properly.  Medical documentation of the disability may be  
needed.  
 
The employee is also expected to make, and support the Company in making, all reasonable effort to 
accommodate others as required by law.

In addition, unlawful harassment or discrimination may include racial slurs, and or derogatory remarks, 
stereotypes, jokes , offensive visuals based on race, age, disability, marital status or any other legally

 20 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  6.2 Personal Leave/Sick Leave  
As legislated, an employ ee is entitled to 3 unpaid sick days per year. In addition to those days, the Company 
will provide employees with an additional five (5) days or 40 hours paid personal/sick leave.  
It is suggested that the employee consider personal/sick leave days as an i nsurance policy against illness 
and emergencies for the year.  It is not additional vacation time and thus cannot be added to a vacation or 
statutory holiday, except in the case of illness.  
Personal/Sick leave is intended to be used for unexpected events;  therefore,  advance notice is not required. 
If an employee chooses to use personal/sick leave for non -emergency use (i.e. medical or dental 
appointment), advance notice should be provided so production and their co -workers are not adversely 
affected by the absence.  P ersonal/sick leave taken beyond the time submitted, or under false pretense, will 
be considered an unauthorized absence.   
Any time which is unused by the end of the calendar year can be either paid out on the first pay of the 
following year or carried ove r into the new year.  If an employee resigns, is terminated, or laid off, any 
remaining personal/sick leave credit will not be paid out .  
Should an employee be required to take  time due to personal or family member’s illness, medical 
appointment or test, a nd their personal/sick leave accumulated to date has been used, the employee is 
required to make the time up or use vacation time .  
If an employee who resigns from the company before the end of the year the employee may be required to 
pay back personal/sic k hours used which have not been accrued. These hours will be deducted from the 
employee’s final pay.  
For example:  
An employee leaves the Company in April, however,  uses all their personal/sick time (40 hours) in January 
to March there may be an adjustment to the employee’s final pay.  
New employees will be eligible for personal/sick leave upon the satisfactory completion of their 
probationary period.  This leave will  be pro -rated based on the employee’s first weeks of employment in 
their first year of service.  
Personal/sick leave can be used in one (1) hour segments, up to a total of forty (40) hours.  Either in advance 
of taking personal health leave or upon return i f the leave was unplanned . 
6.3 Short Term Disability  
Short -term disability applies to illness or injury that persists for up to 120 days.  
This leave requires employee’s healthcare provider complete the Action Aero Medical Form and include:  
a) The date the condition began.  
b) The estimated duration of the leave; and,  
c) A statement advising the employee is unable to perform his/her duties due their current 
condition.  21 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  While on Short Term Disability Leave, for the employee to maintain company health and  dental benefits, 
they will be required to provide payment for their portion of the benefit premiums, by way of e -transfer.

to pay for their contribution  may result in termination of benefits in accordance with our insurance policies.  
When on a Short -Term Medical Leave, the employee is required to contact their Team Leader bi-weekly  to 
provide an update of their progress or change in condition.

of coverage if that disability is due to a pre -existing condition.  That is, any condition for which they were

Workplace Harassment Policy  
Date of Policy : April 1, 2013  
Policy Statement :  
E very employee is entitled to employment free of sexual harassment.  Action Aero commits that all of its 
employees will be treated fairly in the workplace and Action Aero will make every reasonable effort to 
ensure that no employee is subject to discrimination, personal and sexual harassment and other types of 
unwelcome comments and conduct. Employees should take note of the discriminatory practice’s 
provisions of the Human Rights Act R.S.P.E.I. 1988, Cap. H -12, that pertain to rights of persons to seek 
redress under that Act.                                                                                                                                               
 “Harassment” includes any unwelcome behaviour, c onduct or communication directed at any individual 
that is based on gender, marital status, sexual orientation, race, colour, religion, ethnic origin, ancestry, 
family status, place of origin, citizenship, age or disability.  
“Sexual harassment” means any c onduct, comment, gesture or contact of a sexual nature  
a) That is likely to cause offense or humiliation to any employee; or  
b) That might, on reasonable grounds, be perceived by that employee as placing a condition of a sexual 
nature on employment or on any opp ortunity for training or promotion  
The behaviour need not be intentional.  There are three defining characteristics of behavior that constitutes 
sexual harassment:  
• It is of a sexual nature.  
• It is unwelcome.  
• It has detrimental consequences.  
It may include, but is not limited to, the following:

• A demand for sexual favours in return for (continued) employment or more favourable 
employment treatment;

sex or sexual orientation;  
• Displaying pornographic or sexist materials or pictures;  
• Leering (suggestive persistent staring);  
• Physical conduct such as touching, patting or pin ching, with an underlying sexual connotation;  
• Sexual assault.  
 
Sexual harassment can be initiated by either sex against the opposite sex or against a member of the same 
sex. 33 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  What to do if Harassment occurs:  
If you feel that you are being harassed, you need  to immediately make the alleged harasser aware of your 
disapproval and/or uneasiness.  Do not ignore the harassing behaviour.  To avoid any misunderstanding, 
you should clearly state to the person that you perceive the action/behaviour as harassment, and request 
that it stop immediately.  
If a further incident occurs, or if the initial incident is of such a nature that you wish to formally report it, 
you must immediately contact either your Team Leader or President.  You should make a written record 
(statem ent) of all incidents, including the nature of the behaviours, dates, times, witnesses (if any) and any 
action taken to inform the alleged harasser of disapproval.  
The Company’s response to a complaint:  
All complaints will be handled in a confidential an d timely manner.  Investigation of a complaint will 
normally include conferring with the parties involved and any named or apparent witnesses.  Everyone 
involved will be protected from coercion, intimidation, retaliation, interference or discrimination, as  a 
result of lodging the complaint or assisting in the investigation.  
Sexual and/or personal harassment of an employee is considered a serious offense and if found to be true, 
prompt attention and action designed to immediately stop the harassment and to p revent its recurrence 
will be taken.  In addition, any employee who is found to have violated the Company policy will be 
disciplined to the extent that appears appropriate in the circumstances.  Disciplinary action may range 
from a verbal warning to immedi ate termination of employment.   
The Company recognizes that a false accusation of sexual or personal harassment can have serious effects 
on innocent individuals.  Accordingly, we trust that all employees will act in a responsible manner when 
considering m aking a complaint under this policy.

After the probationary period ends, a feedback session will t ake place between the employee and their Team 
Leader, in which the employee is encouraged to provide input. Following the feedback session and 
successful completion of the Controlled Goods Program a decision will be made on whether or not to move 
the emplo yee to a permanent position.   
There may be a situation, where it is determined a probationary period requires an extension to further 
evaluate an employee’s skills. If this is the case, the employee will be made aware of this during the above 
feedback sess ion.  
2.6 Progressive Discipline  
The Company may impose discipline for workplace infractions in its sole and exclusive discretion.

employees may be t erminated if the seriousness of their actions warrant it.  
 9 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  In the event an employee violates company policy or exhibits problematic behavior, a system of 
progressive discipline has been put in place. Employees will be given three (3) opportunities to correct the 
unwanted behavior or actions.  
See steps below:  
Step 1 – Verbal Warning  
A meeting will be arranged,  and the employee will be advised of the issue and asked for their 
interpretation of what occurred. The employee will be informed of the expectati ons of the company and 
suggestions on to improve the behavior so no further action is required. The conversation will be 
documented and added to the employee ’s file. 
Step 2 – Written Warning  
A meeting will take place to address further infractions followin g the Verbal Warning. The concern will be 
reviewed with the employee, explanation requested,  and suggestions of improvement will be provided. The 
employee will be informed further examples of this behavior result in a final written warning. The 
conversatio n will be documented to the employee ’s file. 
Step 3 – Final Warning or Suspension  
A meeting will be held to address the continued behavior, indicating improvements have not been made 
since the Written Warning. An explanation will be requested from the employee,  and they will be advised 
if there continues to be no improvement the next step in the process is termination.  
A suspension may be warranted rather than a termination, if that is the case , the length  and details of the 
suspension would depend on t he circumstances of the incident.  
Step 4 – Termination  
All terminations will be arranged and coordinated through Human Resources.  
2.7 Notice of Termination

to participa te and add feedback. Performance Reviews will be performed at least once a year.  Performance 
reviews are personal and confidential. All employee reviews will be kept in the employee’s personnel file.  
Employees  are strongly encouraged to contact their Team Leader anytime you have a question or concern 
regarding their performance.  
2.12 Attendance   
 
All employees  are expected to be punctual with regular attendance. The company relies on an employee’s 
regular attendance to run an efficient and successful business.  When an employee is absent or late, 
production in their work group is affected.  Absence disrupts wor k planning and places a burden on co -
workers who may have to assume additional duties or are required to work overtime.   
Action Aero recognizes that illness and other personal issues may make it impossible to report to work, in 
these circumstances the Com pany asks that the employee  notify  their Team Leader (prior to their start time) 
and then update Pay Works with their absence. Do not have another person call for you unless it is 
unavoidable.  
We suggest all employees arrive a minimum of 15 minutes prior t o shift start to ensure they are ready to 
begin work at their scheduled time.   
Frequent or excess ive absenteeism or tardiness may result in disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination.  
 
If an employee is going to be absent three or more days due to illness or injury (non -work related) they are 
required to provide medical documentation (Action Aero Medical Form) from their physician to their 
supervisor by the start of day four of the absence. The Physician's note should include:  
a) The date the condit ion began.  
b) The estimated duration of the leave; and,  
c) A statement advising the employee is unable to perform his/her duties due their current 
condition.  
If the illness is anticipated to extend beyond 7 days, the employee will be issued a Record of Employment, 
as they may be eligible for sick pay benefits under Employment Insurance, details of the coverage can be 
found at:  
http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/ei/bene fits/sickness.shtml  12 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  In the case of adverse weather, the Company may decide to delay opening of the facility or close for the

All job vacancies will be posted at the discretion of management. All employees are eligible to apply for 
any job vacancy posted, however to be considered for the position the employee must have satisfactory 
performance evaluations, good attendance and possess the skills ne cessary for the vacated position.  
 
All expressions of interest will be held in confidence. While it is in the interest of Action Aero to provide 
opportunities to existing Action Aero employees, the most suitable of all internal  and external candidates 
will be selected for the position . 
 
2.14 Accommodation  
 
The Company also provides all reasonable accommodations to those with disabilities in compliance with 
the law. The Company has a duty to accommodate up to the  point of undue hardship. Undue Hardship 
may b e considered excessive in cases where the accommodation creates:  
 
● An expense that is difficult for the Company to absorb,  
 
● An undue hindrance  to the proper functioning of the Company,  
 
● A significant impairment of the safety or rights of others.  
 
Consequently, if the Company or service provider can objectively demonstrate that the only 
accommodation, within its reach, would result in one of these consequences, it may refuse the request for 
reasonable accommodation.  
 
It is the employee’s responsibility to bring to the Company’s attention any needs related to any disability 
so the Company can support the employee properly.  Medical documentation of the disability may be  
needed.  
 
The employee is also expected to make, and support the Company in making, all reasonable effort to 
accommodate others as required by law.

In addition, unlawful harassment or discrimination may include racial slurs, and or derogatory remarks, 
stereotypes, jokes , offensive visuals based on race, age, disability, marital status or any other legally

concerns with.

 20 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  6.2 Personal Leave/Sick Leave  
As legislated, an employ ee is entitled to 3 unpaid sick days per year. In addition to those days, the Company 
will provide employees with an additional five (5) days or 40 hours paid personal/sick leave.  
It is suggested that the employee consider personal/sick leave days as an i nsurance policy against illness 
and emergencies for the year.  It is not additional vacation time and thus cannot be added to a vacation or 
statutory holiday, except in the case of illness.  
Personal/Sick leave is intended to be used for unexpected events;  therefore,  advance notice is not required. 
If an employee chooses to use personal/sick leave for non -emergency use (i.e. medical or dental 
appointment), advance notice should be provided so production and their co -workers are not adversely 
affected by the absence.  P ersonal/sick leave taken beyond the time submitted, or under false pretense, will 
be considered an unauthorized absence.   
Any time which is unused by the end of the calendar year can be either paid out on the first pay of the 
following year or carried ove r into the new year.  If an employee resigns, is terminated, or laid off, any 
remaining personal/sick leave credit will not be paid out .  
Should an employee be required to take  time due to personal or family member’s illness, medical 
appointment or test, a nd their personal/sick leave accumulated to date has been used, the employee is 
required to make the time up or use vacation time .  
If an employee who resigns from the company before the end of the year the employee may be required to 
pay back personal/sic k hours used which have not been accrued. These hours will be deducted from the 
employee’s final pay.  
For example:  
An employee leaves the Company in April, however,  uses all their personal/sick time (40 hours) in January 
to March there may be an adjustment to the employee’s final pay.  
New employees will be eligible for personal/sick leave upon the satisfactory completion of their

Workplace Harassment Policy  
Date of Policy : April 1, 2013  
Policy Statement :  
E very employee is entitled to employment free of sexual harassment.  Action Aero commits that all of its 
employees will be treated fairly in the workplace and Action Aero will make every reasonable effort to 
ensure that no employee is subject to discrimination, personal and sexual harassment and other types of 
unwelcome comments and conduct. Employees should take note of the discriminatory practice’s 
provisions of the Human Rights Act R.S.P.E.I. 1988, Cap. H -12, that pertain to rights of persons to seek 
redress under that Act.                                                                                                                                               
 “Harassment” includes any unwelcome behaviour, c onduct or communication directed at any individual 
that is based on gender, marital status, sexual orientation, race, colour, religion, ethnic origin, ancestry, 
family status, place of origin, citizenship, age or disability.  
“Sexual harassment” means any c onduct, comment, gesture or contact of a sexual nature  
a) That is likely to cause offense or humiliation to any employee; or  
b) That might, on reasonable grounds, be perceived by that employee as placing a condition of a sexual 
nature on employment or on any opp ortunity for training or promotion  
The behaviour need not be intentional.  There are three defining characteristics of behavior that constitutes 
sexual harassment:  
• It is of a sexual nature.  
• It is unwelcome.  
• It has detrimental consequences.  
It may include, but is not limited to, the following:  
• An implied or expressed threat of reprisal for failure to comply with a sexually oriented request;  
• A demand for sexual favours in return for (continued) employment or more favourable 
employment treatment;  
• Unwelcome rem arks, jokes, innuendoes, propositions, or taunting about a person’s body, attire, 
sex or sexual orientation;  
• Displaying pornographic or sexist materials or pictures;  
• Leering (suggestive persistent staring);  
• Physical conduct such as touching, patting or pin ching, with an underlying sexual connotation;  
• Sexual assault.  
 
Sexual harassment can be initiated by either sex against the opposite sex or against a member of the same 
sex. 33 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  What to do if Harassment occurs:  
If you feel that you are being harassed, you need  to immediately make the alleged harasser aware of your 
disapproval and/or uneasiness.  Do not ignore the harassing behaviour.  To avoid any misunderstanding, 
you should clearly state to the person that you perceive the action/behaviour as harassment, and request 
that it stop immediately.  
If a further incident occurs, or if the initial incident is of such a nature that you wish to formally report it, 
you must immediately contact either your Team Leader or President.  You should make a written record 
(statem ent) of all incidents, including the nature of the behaviours, dates, times, witnesses (if any) and any 
action taken to inform the alleged harasser of disapproval.  
The Company’s response to a complaint:  
All complaints will be handled in a confidential an d timely manner.  Investigation of a complaint will 
normally include conferring with the parties involved and any named or apparent witnesses.  Everyone 
involved will be protected from coercion, intimidation, retaliation, interference or discrimination, as  a 
result of lodging the complaint or assisting in the investigation.  
Sexual and/or personal harassment of an employee is considered a serious offense and if found to be true, 
prompt attention and action designed to immediately stop the harassment and to p revent its recurrence 
will be taken.  In addition, any employee who is found to have violated the Company policy will be 
disciplined to the extent that appears appropriate in the circumstances.  Disciplinary action may range 
from a verbal warning to immedi ate termination of employment.

documents for a period of thirty -six (36) months following the employees’ termination from the company.  
In addition, to our commitment to protecting the information of the  individua ls we deal with directly; Action 
Aero is also committed to upholding the privacy commitments of our business partners with regard to 
personal information of others that they make available to us in our capacity as a business.  
 
It is the employee’s responsi bility to inform Human Resources of any changes to their personal information 
as soon as possible.   
2.5 Probationary Period  
 
Action Aero recognizes that you put as much thought into choosing your employer as Action Aero did in 
selecting you to be part of the Action Aero Team.  That is why it is important that both you and Action 
Aero have time to assess the decision.  
For all new hires, an introductory or probationary period of six (6) months is stipulated directly in the 
employment agreement. During the pr obationary period, the Team Leader will monitor the new 
employee’s progress and performance. Employees are also expected to ascertain their fit with the 
Company during this time, including learning specific job duties and getting to know other employees.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                   
After the probationary period ends, a feedback session will t ake place between the employee and their Team 
Leader, in which the employee is encouraged to provide input. Following the feedback session and 
successful completion of the Controlled Goods Program a decision will be made on whether or not to move 
the emplo yee to a permanent position.   
There may be a situation, where it is determined a probationary period requires an extension to further 
evaluate an employee’s skills. If this is the case, the employee will be made aware of this during the above 
feedback sess ion.  
2.6 Progressive Discipline  
The Company may impose discipline for workplace infractions in its sole and exclusive discretion. 
Disciplinary action may include, but is not limited to, verbal or written warnings, or suspension. Lastly, 
employees may be t erminated if the seriousness of their actions warrant it.  
 9 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  In the event an employee violates company policy or exhibits problematic behavior, a system of 
progressive discipline has been put in place. Employees will be given three (3) opportunities to correct the 
unwanted behavior or actions.  
See steps below:  
Step 1 – Verbal Warning  
A meeting will be arranged,  and the employee will be advised of the issue and asked for their 
interpretation of what occurred. The employee will be informed of the expectati ons of the company and 
suggestions on to improve the behavior so no further action is required. The conversation will be 
documented and added to the employee ’s file. 
Step 2 – Written Warning  
A meeting will take place to address further infractions followin g the Verbal Warning. The concern will be 
reviewed with the employee, explanation requested,  and suggestions of improvement will be provided. The 
employee will be informed further examples of this behavior result in a final written warning. The 
conversatio n will be documented to the employee ’s file. 
Step 3 – Final Warning or Suspension  
A meeting will be held to address the continued behavior, indicating improvements have not been made 
since the Written Warning. An explanation will be requested from the employee,  and they will be advised 
if there continues to be no improvement the next step in the process is termination.  
A suspension may be warranted rather than a termination, if that is the case , the length  and details of the 
suspension would depend on t he circumstances of the incident.  
Step 4 – Termination  
All terminations will be arranged and coordinated through Human Resources.  
2.7 Notice of Termination  
In the event Action Aero terminates an employee the Employment Standards Act requiring notice will be 
followed, see below:  
● If an employee has worked continuously for more than 6 months but less than 5 years : 2 weeks 
written notice is required.    
● If an employee has worked continuously for more than 5 years, but less than 10 years : 4 weeks 
written notice is required.

written notice is required.    
● If an em ployee has worked continuously for more than 15 years , 8 weeks written notice is required.    
In the event the employee wishes to terminate their employment, they must provide written notice to either 
the President, HR or their Team Leader, as follows:  10 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  ● If an employee has worked continuously for more than 6 months but less than 5 years : 1 weeks 
written notice is required.    
● If an employee has worked continuously for more than 5 years : 2 weeks written notice is required.    
 
During an employee’s probationar y period the employer has the right to terminate an employee without 
notice and without cause, for any reason that is not discriminatory. The employee may terminate the 
agreement without notice during the probationary period.  
Termination for cause may occu r when Progressive Discipline has been followed and there has been no 
change in behavior. Notice of termination is not required.

participation in any political activity, so long as such activity is within the bounds of the law. The 
Company will not take any p unitive action or discriminate against an employee based on their lawful 
political engagement outside the workplace. If an employee engages in any political activity, the 
employee must clearly state that such activity and related statements in no way repre sent the views of the 
Company. Additionally, all Company employees are entitled to their own personal political positions.

Personal  cell phone use can be disruptive to others and limit employee productivity. As such, use outside 
designated breaks and mealtimes  while at work is not permitted  on the shop floor without prior 
authorization .

All employees will participate in the Action Aero annual performance review pro cess.  The purpose of this 
process is to assist the employee and their Team Leader in the evaluation of their performance and to set 
realistic and objective goals for the year ahead. This is an interactive process, and employees are encouraged 
to participa te and add feedback. Performance Reviews will be performed at least once a year.  Performance 
reviews are personal and confidential. All employee reviews will be kept in the employee’s personnel file.  
Employees  are strongly encouraged to contact their Team Leader anytime you have a question or concern 
regarding their performance.  
2.12 Attendance   
 
All employees  are expected to be punctual with regular attendance. The company relies on an employee’s 
regular attendance to run an efficient and successful business.  When an employee is absent or late, 
production in their work group is affected.  Absence disrupts wor k planning and places a burden on co -
workers who may have to assume additional duties or are required to work overtime.   
Action Aero recognizes that illness and other personal issues may make it impossible to report to work, in 
these circumstances the Com pany asks that the employee  notify  their Team Leader (prior to their start time) 
and then update Pay Works with their absence. Do not have another person call for you unless it is 
unavoidable.  
We suggest all employees arrive a minimum of 15 minutes prior t o shift start to ensure they are ready to 
begin work at their scheduled time.   
Frequent or excess ive absenteeism or tardiness may result in disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination.  
 
If an employee is going to be absent three or more days due to illness or injury (non -work related) they are 
required to provide medical documentation (Action Aero Medical Form) from their physician to their 
supervisor by the start of day four of the absence. The Physician's note should include:  
a) The date the condit ion began.  
b) The estimated duration of the leave; and,  
c) A statement advising the employee is unable to perform his/her duties due their current 
condition.  
If the illness is anticipated to extend beyond 7 days, the employee will be issued a Record of Employment, 
as they may be eligible for sick pay benefits under Employment Insurance, details of the coverage can be 
found at:  
http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/ei/bene fits/sickness.shtml  12 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  In the case of adverse weather, the Company may decide to delay opening of the facility or close for the 
day. Any delays/closures will be posted in Pay Works, on the Action Aero Facebook page and Twitter .

take vacation.

2.13 Job Vacancy  
 
All job vacancies will be posted at the discretion of management. All employees are eligible to apply for 
any job vacancy posted, however to be considered for the position the employee must have satisfactory 
performance evaluations, good attendance and possess the skills ne cessary for the vacated position.  
 
All expressions of interest will be held in confidence. While it is in the interest of Action Aero to provide 
opportunities to existing Action Aero employees, the most suitable of all internal  and external candidates 
will be selected for the position . 
 
2.14 Accommodation  
 
The Company also provides all reasonable accommodations to those with disabilities in compliance with 
the law. The Company has a duty to accommodate up to the  point of undue hardship. Undue Hardship 
may b e considered excessive in cases where the accommodation creates:  
 
● An expense that is difficult for the Company to absorb,  
 
● An undue hindrance  to the proper functioning of the Company,  
 
● A significant impairment of the safety or rights of others.  
 
Consequently, if the Company or service provider can objectively demonstrate that the only 
accommodation, within its reach, would result in one of these consequences, it may refuse the request for 
reasonable accommodation.  
 
It is the employee’s responsibility to bring to the Company’s attention any needs related to any disability 
so the Company can support the employee properly.  Medical documentation of the disability may be  
needed.  
 
The employee is also expected to make, and support the Company in making, all reasonable effort to 
accommodate others as required by law.

inappropriate jokes, inappropriate visuals, and any unwelcome touching or unsolicited physical contact. 
In addition, unlawful harassment or discrimination may include racial slurs, and or derogatory remarks, 
stereotypes, jokes , offensive visuals based on race, age, disability, marital status or any other legally

Team Leader. The Team Leader is responsible for looking after the employee’s interests on the job and is 
the person responsible for the activities in the wor k area. They are generally the first person to discuss 
concerns with.

which reserves the right to approve or deny requests.  
 
 20 
Revision Date February 1 3, 2023  6.2 Personal Leave/Sick Leave  
As legislated, an employ ee is entitled to 3 unpaid sick days per year. In addition to those days, the Company 
will provide employees with an additional five (5) days or 40 hours paid personal/sick leave.  
It is suggested that the employee consider personal/sick leave days as an i nsurance policy against illness 
and emergencies for the year.  It is not additional vacation time and thus cannot be added to a vacation or 
statutory holiday, except in the case of illness.  
Personal/Sick leave is intended to be used for unexpected events;  therefore,  advance notice is not required. 
If an employee chooses to use personal/sick leave for non -emergency use (i.e. medical or dental 
appointment), advance notice should be provided so production and their co -workers are not adversely 
affected by the absence.  P ersonal/sick leave taken beyond the time submitted, or under false pretense, will 
be considered an unauthorized absence.
